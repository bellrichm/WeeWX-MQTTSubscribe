# WeeWX-MQTTSubscribe
A Weewx service and driver that receives data from multiple MQTT topics.

Currently MQTT payloads of json, keyword (field1=value, field2=value..), and individual (each topic contains a single observation) are supported. 

## Description
### **Driver** ### 
The driver captures the MQTT payload in a separate thread. Then in *genLoopPackets*, every element in the queue is turned into its own packet. 

It is also possible to subscribe to a second topic. The MQTT payload from this topic is put into a separate queue. This queue is processed by the *genArchiveRecords* to create archive records (simulating hardware generation). With the combination of the two topics/queues, one can have a WeeWX instance gather the data and publish loop and archive data for other instances to receive.

When generating loop packets and the queue becomes empty, the option, wait_before_retry, controls how long before an attempt is made to get data from the queue.
### **Service**
The service can bind to either new loop packets or new archive records. In both cases a separate thread captures the MQTT payload and puts it on a queue. On new packets/records events, the main thread takes the elements from the queue and accumulates them into a single dictionary of data fields. If necessary, the data is converted to the units of the packet/record. The packet/record is then updated with the data.

The elements that are processed from the queue can be controlled by various configuration options. By default, if the MQTT datetime is less than the previous packet's datetime it is ignored. This check can be ignored by setting ignore_start_time to True. It can be controlled more granularly by setting adjust_start_time to the number of seconds prior to the previous packet's datetime is allowed. Also by default, when the MQTT datetime is greater than the packet's datetime, the pocessing of the queue for this packet stops. This check can be ignored by setting ignore_end_time to True. It can be controlled more granularly by setting adjust_end_time to the number of seconds after the packet's datetime is allowed to be processed.

## Installation and running stand-alone notes
Because there are [multiple methods to install WeeWX](http://weewx.com/docs/usersguide.htm#installation_methods), location of files can vary. See [where to find things](http://weewx.com/docs/usersguide.htm#Where_to_find_things) in the WeeWX [User's Guide](http://weewx.com/docs/usersguide.htm") for the definitive information. The following symbolic names are used to define the various locations:

* *$DOWNLOAD_ROOT* - The directory containing the downloaded *MQTTSubscribe* extension.
* *$BIN_ROOT* - The directory where WeeWX executables are located. 
* *$CONFIG_ROOT* - The directory where the configuration (typically, weewx.conf) is located.

Prior to making any updates/changes, always make a backup.

## Preqrequisites
1. Install the paho MQTT client.

    ```
    pip install paho-mqtt
    ```

## Installation
1. Download MQTTSubscribe

    ```
    wget -P $DOWNLOAD_ROOT https://github.com/bellrichm/WeeWX-MQTTSubscribe/archive/v.X.Y.Z.tar.gz
    ```
2. Install MQTTSubscribe
    * As a driver
    
        ```
        $BIN_ROOT/wee_extension --install=$DOWNLOAD_ROOT/v.X.Y.Z.tar.gz
        $BIN_ROOT/wee_config --reconfig
        ```
        
        **Note:** By default when installing, the service is installed and configured, but not enabled. 
        To not install and configure the service (only install the file(s)), 
        set the environment variable MQTTSubscribe_install_type to DRIVER. For example,
        
        ```
        MQTTSubscribe_install_type=DRIVER $BIN_ROOT/wee_extension --install=$DOWNLOAD_ROOT/v.X.Y.Z.tar.gz
        ```
        
        And then configure the driver.
        
        ```
        $BIN_ROOT/wee_config --reconfig
        ```
        In either case, edit the [MQTTSubscribeDriver][\[topics\]] stanza to configure the topics to subscribe to.
    
    * As a service
    
        ```
        $BIN_ROOT/wee_extension --install=$DOWNLOAD_DIR/v.X.Y.Z.tar.gz
        ```
        
        **Note:** By default when installing, the service is installed and configured, but not enabled. 
        To enable, set the environment variable MQTTSubscribe_install_type to SERVICE. For example,
        
        ```
        MQTTSubscribe_install_type=SERVICE $BIN_ROOT/wee_extension --install=$DOWNLOAD_DIR/v.X.Y.Z.tar.gz
        ```
        
        In either case, edit the [MQTTSubscribeService] stanza as required.
        At the very least the [\[topics\]] stanza must be configured to the topics to subscribe to. 
        Other settings such as host and port may need to be changed.
            
3. Optionally run in standalone mode

    ```
    PYTHONPATH=$BIN_ROOT python $BIN_ROOT/user/MQTTSubscribe.py <options> $CONFIG_ROOT/weewx.conf
    ```
4. Restart WeeWX 

    ```
    sudo /etc/init.d/weewx restart
    ```
    
    or
    
    ```
    sudo sudo service restart weewx
    ```
    
    or 
    
    ``` 
    sudo systemctl restart weewx
    ```

## Manual installation instructions
1. Download MQTTSubscribe

    ```
    wget -P $DOWNLOAD_ROOT https://github.com/bellrichm/WeeWX-MQTTSubscribe/archive/v.X.Y.Z.tar.gz
    ```
2. Unpack MQTTSubscribe

    ```
    tar xvfz v.X.Y.Z.tar.gz
    ```
3. Copy the file

    ```
    cp $DOWNLOAD_ROOT/v.X.Y.X/bin/user/MQTTSubscribe.py $BIN_ROOT/user
    ```
4. Configure
    * As a driver
    
        ```
        $BIN_ROOT/wee_config --reconfig
        ```
        Edit the [MQTTSubscribeDriver] stanza to configure the topics to subscribe to.
        
        ```
        [MQTTSubscribeDriver]
            [[topics]]
                [[[topic1]]]
                [[[topic2]]]
         ```

    * As a service    
        Configure as required and add the service to WeeWX. 
        
        ```
        [MQTTSubscribeService]
            host = localhost
            payload_type = json
            [[topics]]
                [[[topic1]]]
                [[[topic2]]]
        [Engine]
            [[Services]]
                data_services = user.MQTTSubscribe.MQTTSubscribeService
         ```
## Running stand-alone 
To aid in development and debugging, both the service and driver can be run "stand-alone" via:

```
PYTHONPATH=$BIN_ROOT python $BIN_ROOT/user/MQTTSubscribe.py <options> $CONFIG_ROOT/weewx.conf
```

Where the options are:

```
--verbose 
    Verbose logging.
--console
    Write all logging to the console/terminal.
    This will override the setting in weewx.conf.
--type [driver|service] 
    Run  as driver or service
--records N
    Create N records or packets
--interval N
    Number of seconds between packet or record generation.
-- delay N
    The archive delay in seconds.
--delay N
    Number of seconds delay to wait after the archive period is over
--binding [archive|loop]
    Bind to either new packets or records when running the service. 
    This will override the setting in weewx.conf.
    Process loop/packet or archive.record when running the driver.
--units [US|METRIC|METRICWX]
    The units of the packet/record passed to the service. Only used when running the service.
```

Examples:

* Bind the service to new archive records and update two records.

    ```
    PYTHONPATH=$BIN_ROOT python $BIN_ROOT/user/MQTTSubscribe.py $CONFIG_ROOT/weewx.conf --type service --binding archive --interval 300 --delay 15 --records 2 weewx.conf
    ```

* Run as a driver every 2 seconds generate a loop packet for a total of 30.


    ```
    PYTHONPATH=$BIN_ROOT python $BIN_ROOT/user/MQTTSubscribe.py $CONFIG_ROOT/weewx.conf --type driver --binding loop --interval 2 --records 30 weewx.conf
    ```
